# **PCOS Prediction Using Random Forest**  

## **Overview**  
This project focuses on predicting Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using a Random Forest model based on the **"Exploring Predictive Health Factors of PCOS"** dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to analyze key health factors influencing PCOS and build a robust machine-learning model to assist in early detection and diagnosis.  

## **Project Features**  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes the **Random Forest** algorithm for classification.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, feature selection, and scaling for optimal performance.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure predictive performance.  
- **Web Application**: Built with **Flask** for backend processing and a **Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript** frontend, including a **pie chart visualization** of results.  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset is sourced from Kaggleâ€™s **"Exploring Health Data Factors of PCOS"** competition - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/exploring-predictive-health-factors 

## **Technology Stack**  
- **Machine Learning**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Backend**: Flask  
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript (includes a **pie chart visualization**)  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## **How It Works**  
1. **Data Processing**: Cleans and prepares data for training.  
2. **Model Training**: Trains a **Random Forest** classifier to predict PCOS based on health attributes.  
3. **Web Interface**: Users can enter health parameters through a simple and responsive frontend.  
4. **Prediction & Results**: The model processes the input and provides a prediction with a **graphical representation** of probabilities.
